### Interactive Elections Map
I built an [interactive elections results map](https://spinnernicholas.github.io/InteractiveElectionMap/public/index.html). The goal is to provide a simple, easy to use elections map that anyone can fork to create one for their region/election. It is completely static so it can be easily deployed using GitHub pages. I'm looking for other developers who are interested in contributing.
